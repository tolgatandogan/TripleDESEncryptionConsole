# TripleDESEncryptionConsole
This console application demonstrates the use of the TripleDES encryption algorithm for securing sensitive data. The project includes an EncryptionHelper class that provides methods to encrypt and decrypt text using TripleDES. Input data is accepted from the user via the console interface, and the application showcases the process of encrypting and decrypting the provided text.

Key Features:
- Securely encrypt and decrypt text using TripleDES algorithm.
- User-friendly console interface for input and output.
- Illustrates encryption and decryption processes step-by-step.

Usage:
1. Enter the text to be encrypted when prompted.
2. Observe the encrypted output.
3. Enter the encrypted text to decrypt and see the original content.

Note: This project is intended for educational purposes and serves as a simple example of data encryption using TripleDES.

Feel free to use, modify, and learn from this code for your encryption needs.
